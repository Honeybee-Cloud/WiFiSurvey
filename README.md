## About
The WiFi Survey app is being developed to aid the larger [Honeybee Project](https://hnyb.app). The goal is to create a simple app to survey an area for WiFi activity. This information can then be used to plan, design, and build mesh networks.

## Install
We do not currently provide pre-built APKs because of the use of Google Maps SDK. To provide you own see the guide [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key).

## Current Features
1) Can take GPS location pings and WiFi scans. 
2) Can export this data as a CSV file.
3) Can display the location pings on a Google maps activity.

## Planned Features
1) Heatmaps.
2) Integration with ELK stack.
3) Useful display of scan information
